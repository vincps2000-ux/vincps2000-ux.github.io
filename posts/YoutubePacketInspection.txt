Used wireshark while running video to capture some packets.
--> Encrypted using quic
What is quic? 

UDP  (Single handshake? How?) based, UDP is connectionless --> Errorprone, quic is protocol top fix those errors.
Copared to tls(complex handshake) --> faster intial data time.
Quic allows multiplexing on same connection with errorhandling.
Allows serving ads same time as showing video.
Also handles network migration changes e.g.  wifi to 4g

Experiment is dead from here, even ASN attribution to youtube of packets not possible.
Testing with github(using TCP) allows proper ASN Lookup (140.82.121.5)
