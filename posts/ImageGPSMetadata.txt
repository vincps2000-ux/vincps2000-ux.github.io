Used exiftool (https://exiftool.org/) to manipulate picture metadata, so it appears to be shot at the Spynx.

Problems at Install:
exiftool is a clitool, when trying to integrate it as a System-variable, for easy cli access,
The path to the exiftool folder did not show up in %Path%. This was due to too many Path Variables already being configured.
I do not know why windows doesnt at least warn the User. Everything went smooth after that.

Commands Used:
To write location data:
exiftool -GPSLatitude=29.9753 -GPSLongitude=31.1376 Imagepath
To check if changes took: 
exiftool Imagepath
