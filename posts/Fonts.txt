Researched Fonts, Installed Jetbrains mono for the lignatures :
https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#how-to-install

Lignatures needed to be enabled in VSC-Settings, required Settings:
"editor.fontFamily": "'JetBrains Mono', monospace",
"editor.fontLigatures": true

monospace means every symbol is same-length,
the monospace in the "editor.fontFamily" setting is a fallback for system default monospace should Jetbrains Mono be missing
