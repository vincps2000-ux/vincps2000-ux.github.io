Installed Jenkins(https://www.jenkins.io/) locally, created new user using command:
net user exampleuser examplepassword /add 
allowed user to log on as service using 
Win + R --> secpol.msc
Completed Install --> Basic Configuration of Admin, etc.
Interesting: Default admin-pw was provided as File in installed Program.
Build simple Git-automation Pipeline, which stages & commits for now.

Also solved leetcode 190, reversing bitwise representation of a int. 
Key insight: using Bitset with normal constructor, reversing using normal for-Loop into another Bitset. Converting to unsigned long and then to int via cast.
