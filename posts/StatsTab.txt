Added a Tab named Statistics, that wil display the Data gathered by last days Project.
Questions for the Data i am gathering:
Is there a diffrence in Activity on different Weekdays / Vacation / Moonphases / Seasons ?
Will the keystroke metric changed based on AI Progress in the Next Years?

Stats are kept in seperate file, outside of /posts Folder.
