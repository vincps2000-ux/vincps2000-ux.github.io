Solved LeetCode Problem 67, a simple addition Programm for two binary Numbers.
Key insight was adding a Carry Int, and finding the String functions pop_back() and back():
https://cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/pop_back/
https://cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/back/
This significantly eased my Problems in navigating the Strings correctly from the first bit.
The Rest was just remembering the Syntax.
