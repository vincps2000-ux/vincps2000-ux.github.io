In order to judge AI Coding Quality Independently, I created a small personal Benchmark:

The Goal is to programm a Grid-based Mech-Design game:
Advantages:
Such a Game currently doesnt exist.
Playing it quickly gives an Impression of the Design Capabilities of the AI.

Benchmark:
https://github.com/vincps2000-ux/MechGameBenchmark

I plan on adding higher Fidelity Versions of the Benchmark later, for better comparisons.

Ran the benchmark with GithubCopilot(Claude Opus 4.6), Results:

Take Aways: 
Good Technical Execution, strong at crating functional Art without access to Art Generator.
Poor Difficulty/Playability Tuning. 
    A shared Upgrade Money Pool/ Contract Pool leads to quick Softlocks.
    A Basic mech with no Modules Succeds most Contracts fully.
    No Tool Tips.
Low creativity:
    every Component presented was very vanilla, example given Light/Medium/Heavy Torso.
    Every Effect was only a simple add subtract of Stats. Both a Railgun and a Sword just give Firepower.
